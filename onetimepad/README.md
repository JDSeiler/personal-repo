# One time pad generator
This is one of my very old python projects, from when I had just started learning. It certainly has many shortcomings,
but I keep it on GitHub to show how much I've learned and changed as a programmer. Having old code archived lets me
look back and see how I would approach a problem today in comparison to how I approached it months or years ago.
