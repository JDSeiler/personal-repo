This repo is for various bits of code I've written over the years.
It mostly serves as an archive, but on occasion I'll add some fresh code.

## Repository map
* algorithms :: Contains examples of some common algorithms.
* ISS :: Draws the position of the ISS using Python's Turtle module.
* onetimepad :: [One time pad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) generator and one of my first 'projects' ever.
* rust-code :: Thing that I've written in the wonderful language of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
  * pre-calc :: Command line **pre**fix notation **calc**ulator, written as a project to begin learning Rust.
  * brownian:: Generates PNG images of [random walks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk), still WIP but functional.
    	       Named brownian because a random walk, when the step size is small enough, approximates [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion)
* scram :: Command line utility for generating 3x3 Rubik's Cube scrambles, written in Go.
* typescript-example :: Firebase cloud function I wrote for [Biblink](https://github.com/Biblink/biblink-backend).
